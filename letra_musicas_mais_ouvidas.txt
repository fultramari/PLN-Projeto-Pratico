Letra da música: When I Was Your Man
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sounds like uh, uh, uh

Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.



My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways

Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made

And that hurts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh



Too young, too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.



Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong

Oh, I know I'm probably much too late

To try and apologize for my mistakes

But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand

Give you all his hours when he has the chance

Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

Letra da música: Just the Way You Are
Oh her eyes her eyes 
Make the stars look like they're not shining. 
Her hair , her hair 
falls perfectly without her trying 
She's so beautiful and I tell her every day 



I know, I know 

When I compliment her she wont believe me 

And it's so, it's so 

Sad to think she don't see what I see 



But every time she asks me 'Do I look okay?' I say 



When I see your face 

There's not a thing that I would change 

Cause you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



And when you smile 

The whole world stops and stares for a while 

'Cause girl you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



Her lips, her lips 

I could kiss them all day if she'd let me 



Her laugh, Her laugh 

She hates but I think it's so sexy 



She's so beautiful and i tell her every day 



Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change 

If perfect is what you're searching for 

Then just stay the same 



So don't even bother asking if you look okay 

You know I say 



When I see your face 

There's not a thing that I would change 

Cause you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



And when you smile 

The whole world stops and stares for a while 

'Cause girl you're amazing 

just the way you are 



The way you are 

The way you are 

Girl you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



When I see your face 

There's not a thing that I would change 

'Cause you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



And when you smile 

The whole world stops and stares for a while 

'Cause girl you're amazing 

Just the way you are 



Yeaaaah

Letra da música: Talking to the Moon
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back
My neighbours think I'm crazy

But they don't understand

You're all I have

You're all I have



At night when the stars light on my room

I sit by myself 

Talking to the Moon

Tryn' to get to You

In hopes you're on the other side

Talking to me too

Oh Am I a fool who sits alone

Talking to the moon?



I'm feeling like I'm famous

The talk of the town

They say I've gone mad

Yeah, I've gone mad



But they don't know what I know

Cause when the sun goes down

someone's talking back

Yeah, They're talking back



At night when the stars light on my room

I sit by myself 

Talking to the Moon

Tryn' to get to You

In hopes you're on the other side

Talking to me too

Oh Am I a fool who sits alone

Talking to the moon?



Do you ever hear me calling?



'Cause every night

I'm Talking to the Moon

Still tryn' to get to You

In hopes you're on the other side

Talking to me too

Oh Am I a fool who sits alone

Talking to the moon?



I know you're somewhere out there

Somewhere far away

Letra da música: It Will Rain
If you ever leave me, baby, 
Leave some morphine at my door 
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication 
To realize what we used to have, 
We don't have it anymore. 


There's no religion that could save me 

No matter how long my knees are on the floor 

So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin' 

Will keep you by my side 

And keep you from walkin' out the door. 



Cause there'll be no sunlight 

If I lose you, baby 

There'll be no clear skies 

If I lose you, baby 

Just like the clouds 

My eyes will do the same if you walk away 

Everyday, it'll rain, rain, rain 

 

I'll never be your mother's favorite 

Your daddy can't even look me in the eye 

Oooo if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing 

Sayin' there goes my little girl 

Walkin' with that troublesome guy 



But they're just afraid of something they can't understand 

Oooo but little darlin' watch me change their minds 

Yea for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try 

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding 

If that'll make you mine 



Cause there'll be no sunlight 

If I lose you, baby 

There'll be no clear skies 

If I lose you, baby 

Just like the clouds 

My eyes will do the same if you walk away 

Everyday, it will rain, rain, rain 



Oh don't just say, goodbye 

Don't just say, goodbye 

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding 

If that'll make it right 



Cause there'll be no sunlight 

If I lose you, baby 

And there'll be no clear skies 

If I lose you, baby 

And just like the clouds 

My eyes will do the same if you walk away 

Everyday, it'll rain, rain, rain

Letra da música: Grenade
Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take take take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss

Had your eyes wide open

Why were they open?



Gave you all I had

And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, you did

To give me all your love

Is all I ever asked

Cause what you don't understand

Is I'd catch a grenade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

Throw my hand on the blade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'd jump in front of a train for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know I'd do anything for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)



I would go through all this pain

Take a bullet straight through my brain

Yes I would die for you, baby

But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no



Black, black, black and blue

Beat me till I'm numb

Tell the devil I said 

hey when you get back to where you're from

Bad woman, bad woman

That's just what you are

Yeah, you smile in my face 

then rip the breaks out my car



Gave you all I had

And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, yes you did

To give me all your love

Is all I ever asked

Cause what you don't understand

Is I'd catch a grenade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

Throw my hand on the blade for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'd jump in front of a train for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know I'd do anything for ya 

(yeah, yeah, yeah)



I would go through all this pain

Take a bullet straight through my brain

Yes I would die for you, baby

But you won't do the same



If my body was on fire

You would watch me burn down in flames

You said you loved me, you're a liar

Cause you never ever ever did, baby



But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya 

Throw my hand on the blade for ya

I'd jump in front of a train for ya

You know I'd do anything for ya



I would go through all this pain

Take a bullet straight through my brain

Yes I would die for ya baby

But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same

Oh, you never do the same

You never do the same, no, no, no, no
