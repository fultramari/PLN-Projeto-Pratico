Letra da música: Young Girls
I spend all my money on a big ol' fancy car
For these bright eyed honeys
Oh yeah you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why

Guess I've always been this way

All these roads still be wrong

But I still drive them all night long, all night long



All you young wild girls

You make a mess of me

Yeah you young wild girls

You'll be the death of me, the death of me

All you young wild girls

No matter what you do

Yeah you young wild girls

I'll always come back to you, come back to you



I get lost under these lights

I get lost in the words I say

Start believing my own lies

Like everything will be okay

Oh I still dream of simple life

Boy meets girl makes her his wife

But love don't exist when you live like this that much I know, yes I know



All these roads still weave on

But I still drive them all night long, all night long



All you young wild girls

You make a mess of me

Yeah you young wild girls

You'll be the death of me, the death of me

All you young wild girls

No matter what you do

Yeah you young wild girls

I'll always come back to you, come back to you



You, you, you, you

Yeah you you you

You you you you

You you you



All you young wild girls

You make a mess of me

Yeah you young wild girls

You'll be the death of me, the death of me

All you young wild girls

No matter what you do

Yeah you young wild girls

I'll always come back to you, come back to you

Letra da música: Gorilla
Uh 
I got a body full of liquor 
With a cocaine kicker 
And I'm feeling like I'm 30 feet tall 

So lay it down, lay it down 



You got your legs up in the sky 

With the devil in your eyes 

Let me hear you say 

You want it all 



Say it now, say it now 



Look what you're doing 

Look what you've done 

But in this jungle you can't run

But you don't look like you're scared 

You just smile and tell me daddy it's yours 

Cuz you know how I like it, you's a dirty little lover 



If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff 

Call the SWAT, we don't stop 

We keep rocking while they knocking on our door 

And you're screaming give it to me baby, give it to me motherfucker 



Oh look what you're doing 

Look what you've done 

But in this jungle you can't run

Letra da música: Moonshine
Hello
You know you look even better than the way you did now before
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary

This world aint for you, and I know for damn sure this world aint for me

Lift off and say goodbye

Just let your fire set me free

Ohhh



Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight

Take us to that special place

That place we went the last time, the last time



I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long

And everybody that's around they know that im not myself when you gone

It's good to see you again, good to see you again

On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life

Life's not so bad when you're way up this high

Everything is alright, everything is alright



Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight

Take us to that special place

That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh



Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive

Take us to that special place

That place we went the last time, the last time



Tu-ru-tu dont you never look back

We are not afraid to die young and live fast

Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs

Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone



Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight

Take us to that special place

That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh



Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive

Take us to that special place

That place we went the last time, the last time

Letra da música: When I Was Your Man
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sounds like uh, uh, uh

Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.



My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways

Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made

And that hurts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh



Too young, too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.



Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong

Oh, I know I'm probably much too late

To try and apologize for my mistakes

But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand

Give you all his hours when he has the chance

Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Letra da música: Natalie
Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Long turn on a dusty road
I did it too much so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind

'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright

Like my daddy im a gambling man

Never been afraid of roll the dice

But when I put my bet on her

Little miss snake eyes ruined my life

She better sleep with one eye open 

Better make sure to loock her door 

Cause once I get my hands on her, imma ooohh



Natalie, she ran away with all my money

And she did it for fun

Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny

Well i’m diggin a ditch for this gold digging bitch, 

Watch out she's quick

Look out for pretty little thing named Natalie, 

if you see her tell her im coming She better run



The good lord better bless your soul

Cause I dont know already cursed your name

Dont matter which way you go

Payback's gonna come your way

You'll be begging me, please please please

And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh

Why is it that cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night

I spend a lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)

I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)

Cant nobody save you now

So there aint no use in try

Once again my hands on you, imma oooh



Natalie, she ran away with all my money 

And she did it for fun

Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny

Well i’m diggin a dicht for this gold digging bitch 

Watch out she's quick

Look out for pretty little thing named Natalie, 

if you see her tell her im coming She better run



I should've known better

Cause when we were together

She never said forever

Im a fool that played in her game



Natalie, she ran away with all my money 

And she did it for fun

Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny

Well i’m diggin a ditch for this gold digging bitch 

Watch out she's quick

Look out for pretty little thing named Natalie, 

if you see her tell her im coming She better run

Letra da música: If I Knew
Oh Oh I, I was a city boy
Riding to danger's where i'd always run, a boy who had his fun
I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew, one day you would come

Now baby, now baby, now baby

Oh oh I, I know it breaks your heart

To picture the only one you wanna love

In somebody's elses arms

But I wouldn't have done

All the things that I've done

If I knew, one day you would come



Now baby, now baby, now baby

Ohh baby please

Lets leave the past behind us

So that we can go where love will find us

Yeah will find us



I know once girls would leave me

But I know that you believe me



Baby I, I wish we were seventeen

So I could give you all the innocence

That you gave to me

No, I wouldnt have done

All the things that I have done

If I knew one day you would come

If I knew one day you would come
